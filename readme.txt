changes from previous MEL dropbox sim (uploaded 09MAY17)

coef_mix_shear changed from 0.3 to 0.2
sw_factor changed from 1 to 0.6
wind_factor changed from 1 to 0.7

These changes all improved the shape of the epilimnion relative to field data.

depth of SSS outflow changed from 498 to 506.9 (basically made it a normal surface outflow)

After having tried this outflow at several depths, I don't see substantial changes once you move the outflow out of the hypolimnion in terms of
thermocline depth. Personally, if we are going to make the SSS outflow depth a kludge, I support just making it a normal surface outflow for now
because I think a submerged outflow could cause further challenges in other variables later as well.
